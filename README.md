# UKSF Modpack

UKSF SR3 Mod Development and issue/feature tracking

#### Contributing

To contribute to our modpack, you are welcome to work on your own mods.
They must be cleared by SR3 and command beforehand, otherwise you may be let
down once it's done. You can help out with the ongoing development by looking
for potential bugs in our modpack, or by contributing new features. To
contribute something to our mods, submit pull requests for review by SR3. Mods
must be based on the CBA framework.

#### Setting up CBA framework

I would prefer mods to be built using the CBA framework, however, if the mod is
simple, build it how you like. If it involves more than a couple of
scripts/features, then use the CBA framework.

Follow the ACE3 guide on how to set this up. Certain areas will not apply (you
don't need to clone ACE3, for example). Best talk to Beswick.T for help on
setting this up.
