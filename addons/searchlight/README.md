# Swing Searchlight

A module that causes AI in searchlights to swing from left to right. Going in 'combat' stance will interrupt this.

To use, sync the module to any searchlights. One module per searchlight can also be used to keep EDEN tidy.

# Known Issues

- Doesn't work well on piers and docks. It runs off terrain height so will take the sea bed as its base height.

- Looks odd on hills, will try and scan towards the top and bottom of a hill if placed on the side of one.

Make sure to check all the searchlights before uploading the mission.
