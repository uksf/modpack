# Cleanup

Cleans up dead units, vehicles, and objects, after a set delay.

- 3den settings module allows enabling/disabling of cleanup, and setting of delay.
- 3den attribute allows unit/vehicle/object to be excluded from cleanup.
- Zeus exclude/include modules allow exclusion or inclusion from cleanup. Previously excluded units/vehicles/objects can still be included, and will be deleted after the delay time.
